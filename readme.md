# API Buddy

An intelligent, Postman-like platform that automates API testing using AI capabilities. This tool simplifies manual and batch endpoint testing with features like AI error explanation, collection file upload, JWT support, request preview, test summary, and a modern UI/UX tailored for productivity.

---

## Motivation

While traditional tools like Postman provide a solid manual API testing experience, there's a gap in:

- Automatically explaining **why** an API failed
- Providing test summaries for entire collections
- Allowing batch testing with **prompt-based** enhancements
- Simplifying both **collection-based** and **manual URL input** testing under one UI

**API Buddy** aims to fill that gap by integrating AI into the workflow while keeping the experience developer-friendly.

---

## Key Features

### Manual URL Input Form

- Fully functional form for manual requests.
- Set:

  - Endpoint name
  - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
  - Target URL
  - Headers
  - Optional request body

- Immediate test execution with visual response feedback.

### Collection File Upload (Postman JSON)

- Upload a `.json` file exported from Postman.
- Automatically parses and extracts:

  - Name
  - Method
  - URL
  - Headers
  - Body (if applicable)

- Supports batch testing for all extracted endpoints.

### JWT Auth Token UI

- Input and store JWT tokens in a dedicated UI field.
- Automatically reused in `Authorization` headers for all requests.
- Option to clear/reset the token easily.

### Test Result View + Error Parsing

- Clean and formatted response display:

  - Supports stringified objects/arrays
  - Displays raw and parsed error content (even HTML)

- Highlights key response properties and status codes.
- Enhanced readability for developers during failure analysis.

### Dual Tab UI

- Simple tab-based layout for:

  - Collection Upload
  - Manual Input

- Only one mode active at a time for a clean, non-conflicting UX.

### Response Table with Summary

- Displays results in a table view:

  - Endpoint-wise status
  - Individual response time

- Shows overall summary:

  - Passed
  - Failed
  - Total tests
  - Avg. response time

### AI-Powered Explanation (Gemini)

- For failed endpoints:

  - Click **"Explain"**
  - Gemini AI analyzes request, response, and error
  - Provides a human-friendly reason for the failure

### Modal Output for AI

- AI explanation is displayed in a modal:

  - Clean formatting
  - Actionable insights where possible

### Security Analyzer Module

- Automatically detects common API security issues:
  - Missing headers like **CORS**, **Content-Security-Policy**, etc.
  - Use of insecure **HTTP** URLs instead of **HTTPS**
  - Unsafe handling of **authentication tokens**
- Flags security warnings directly in the test results view
- Helps developers identify and address vulnerabilities early

### Save & View Test History

- Enables users to save results of API tests (manual or from collections) for later viewing.
- Stores:

  - Test type
  - Test name
  - Request details: method, URL, headers, body
  - Response details: status code, data, duration, warnings, and concise error summaries
  - Timestamp and overall status

- View full test result by ID with a raw JSON viewer for advanced inspection.
- Helps maintain a historical record for debugging or auditing.
- Built using MongoDB, Express, RTK Query, and Tailwind UI.

### Dashboard

The **Dashboard** gives a visual summary of all recent API tests which are saved in history.

- **Summary Cards**

  - Total Tests, Success, Failure, and HTTP Methods count.

- **Tabs for Insights**

  - **Recent**: Latest 10 tests with search.
  - **By Method**: HTTP method distribution (GET, POST, etc.).
  - **By Status**: Success vs Failure count.
  - **Response Time**: Pie chart of duration ranges.
  - **Status Codes**: Count of each HTTP status.
  - **Warnings/Errors**: Error type breakdown.

- **Performance Chart**
  - Top 5 slowest requests to debug latency.
